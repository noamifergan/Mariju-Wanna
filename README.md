## About

Mariju-wanna takes the guesswork away from enjoying marijuana. When going to a coffee shop, instead of assuming what the strain does or relying on the seller, the user can now quickly take out their phone, type in the name and immediately get a reliable description. In addition, the user can search for a plethora of strains by race, effect, or flavor!

## 100% Swift, 100% programmatically

Mariju-wanna was built with no Storyboard, no Xib or nib files. All UI elements were built programmatically, and all cells were custom made, and with ZERO dependencies

## The Strain API

All information on the app is gained through the Strain API, with JSON parsing using the Codeable protocol on Swift.
